                    <div class="intro_title">numberz</div>
                    <p>numberz is a fintech startup focussed on building products to help businesses manage their cash flow and account receivables.
                    I joined numberz as one of their first designers and led the design of cashflow management - ios app single-handedly. 
                    After successfully launching the app, I worked with founders on a few product ideas around GST tax filing & payment collections for Chartered Accountants. 
                    By this time I had built a multi-disciplinary design team comprising of talents with complementary competencies: a ux intern, ux researcher-cum-designer & a ux-engg. 
                    Together we designed, validated & released Account Receivables web app in early 2018.</p>

                    <div class="info">

                    <p>The brief was to design a simple invoicing & expense management ios app that helps numberz’s existing web app customers 
                        manage their business anytime & anywhere on mobile. We followed ios first approach since the existing user base 
                        was mostly iphone users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I studied the existing web app and sifted through customer complaints to identify the problem areas in the workflows. 
                        I got founder's alignment on 'not replicating the web experience on app' since the user expectation and interactions on mobile are different. 
                        Thinking mobile forced us to think about what’s really important for customers. As a result, we designed & 
                        released the core functionalities first, i.e. letting customer create, send and track invoices & expenses and 
                        view critical reports with ease on mobile.</p>

                    <div class="target_title">Target customers</div>

                        and small businesses owners.</p>

                    <p>Account receivable is a CRM of payment collection designed to make collecting money fast, easy, and highly predictable. 
                        It was initially conceptualised & built as an easy to use invoice presentment tool to help mid-size businesses get a one shot-view of 
                        their outstanding: due, overdue invoices they need to chase for payment collection, with the help of a lightweight automated reminder engine. 
                        The p.o.c was thoroughly validated in the presale customer interactions both by sales, design & pm team with the help of design prototypes. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once we got enough validations and decent customer adoption at the mid-size business segment, we designed and upgraded it to full-fledged 
                        CRM for collections to fulfill the needs of large businesses with dedicated finance & collection teams struggling with 
                        tedious excels in managing their collections.</p>

                        their customers pay on time so that their business cashflow remains healthy. Customers many times take 15-50 days to pay 
                        over the assigned credit period and this puts business cashflow at risk. The existing ERP solutions don't cover workflows 
                        around payment collections like keeping a track of business & customer interaction on payments/disputes. Hence, reducing the 
                        scope of tracking data that reflects customer’s behavior dynamically, and on a real-time basis.</p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Solution:&nbsp</span>We designed CRM for payment collection with integrated task & activity 
                        workflows to manage collection at customer & invoice level, tracking every bit of information generated during the interaction 
                        and progress in real-time. The solution helps the collection team follow up on prioritized tasks, track expected payments, 
                        promise-to-pay & solve payment disputes. It also offers insights on the collection team’s performance and better visibility of 
                        high & low-risk customers. Designing for better visibility of information that will aid in timely collection & the workflows 
                        around it was the challenge we had.</p>

                    <p>Designing an enterprise application means one has to deal with tons of data and grids and tables. 
                        Efficient data tables allow users to scan, analyze, compare, filter, sort, and manipulate information to derive insights and 
                        take informed actions. Some of the fundamental principles that guided the table design process: </p>

                    <p>1. Ability to scan lots of data at once, i.e., show various status & data types like numerals & text.</p>
                    <p>2. Help user take informed actions by easy comparison of data in columns & rows.</p>

                    <p>An early investment in designing a basic UI style guide in parallel with product helped significantly in 
                        building proof of concepts fast be it at a feature level or a whole new product being conceptualized from grounds up. 
                        I didn't have to re-invent the wheel to think about fundamentals like color, use of icons, typography, buttons, etc. 
                        This also helped me achieve an almost consistent design language in my workflows, across all products.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As our product scaled, and so did our design team. More no. of UI components were designed, old components like filters, date pickers, tables, 
                        etc were improved upon to solve more business use cases. By the time I had one more designer contributing to designing component and another 
                        consuming it, hence the need to make our guidelines more mature & accessible so that it's easier to use and clearer to discern both for designers 
                        & developers with various backgrounds.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by Brad Frost’s Atomic Design methodology I re-organized our basic UI style guides by segregating
                        UI components into atoms, molecules, organisms & templates, such that ‘the part shapes the whole
                        and the whole shapes the part’ philosophy was more evident. This helped designers while designing
                        a composite component as they would know what all fundamental components they could re-use to build
                        the whole. This re-organization also helped in cleaning & restructuring certain composite components
                        (molecules & organisms) which were detached from already defined UI fundamentals (atoms).</p>
